# Grails3.0-Spock-Reports-Sample
This project is a sample on how to use Spock-Reports with Grails 3.0

Either run it with `gradlew test` or (if you have Grails 3.0 installed) with `grails test-app`. 

See https://rdmueller.github.io/Spock-Reports-with-Grails-3.0/ for details.

PS: make sure to use JDK7 or lower since Spock-Reports still has some issues with JDK8: https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports/issues/44
